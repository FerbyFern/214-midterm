üí° Inside that dataset, contains information about the book, number of pages in the book, the book types, the book descriptions, and the book prices. This dataset is an easy-to-understand and relatively complete dataset with a total of 270 rows and 7 columns:

| Column Name | Column Details | Data Type |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|Rating|Book popularity rating|numeric|
|Reviews|Number of reviews on this book|numeric|
|Book_title|Name of the book|character| 
|Description|Description of the book|character| 
|Number_Of_Pages|Number of pages in the book|numeric|
|Type|The type of book (E.g. Hardcover, Kindle Edition, Paperback, etc.)|character| 
|Price|Average price of the book in USD|numeric| 

üí° But this dataset has some minor modifications to the column type, the term "Boxed Set" should be omitted from "Boxed Set - Hardcover".

## üìå Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

The Tidyverse library contains the following packages:
 1. `ggplot2`
 2. `tribble`
 3. `tidyr`
 4. `readr`
 5. `purr`
 6. `dplyr`
 7. `stringr`
 8. `forcats`

Cleaning data column "Type" the word "Box set"
```R
