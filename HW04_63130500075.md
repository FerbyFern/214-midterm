    - [Data in CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv)

### Outlines
1. Explore the dataset
2. Learning function from Tidyverse
3. Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data
4. Visualization with GGplot2

## Part 1: Explore the dataset

```
# Library
library(readr) #for reading csv
library(dplyr) #for %>% uses
library(ggplot2) #for plotting graph
library(stringr) #in case of changing of data format
library(DescTools) # For better use in exploring data + more function

# Dataset
Books <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sit-2021-int214/027-Quickest-Electric-Cars/main/assignment/Homework04/HW04_63130500087/data.csv")

In this dataset has a list of 270 books in the field of computer science and programming related topics. The information has been compiled from popular websites. Inside that dataset, contains information about the book, number of pages in the book, the book types, the book descriptions, and the book prices.
| Column Name | Column Details | Data Type |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|Rating|Book popularity rating|numeric|
|Reviews|Number of reviews on this book|numeric|
|Book_title|Name of the book|character| 
|Description|Description of the book|character| 
|Number_Of_Pages|Number of pages in the book|numeric|
|Type|The type of book (E.g. Hardcover, 	
Kindle Edition, Paperback, etc.)|character| 
|Price|Average price of the book in USD|numeric| 


## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

- Function `arrange()` from package [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#select-columns-with-select)). It using for select columns

```
Books %>% arrange(Price)
```
** You can sepearate this part or combine in part of `Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data`

## Part 3: Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data

//Explain here

```
#Code here

#Copy Result from console to here
```
//Explain

- list 1
- list 2

## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) Graph show relation between height and mass
```
scat_plot <- starwars %>% filter(mass<500) %>% ggplot(aes(x=height,y=mass))+
  geom_point(aes(color=gender))

scat_plot+geom_smooth()
```
Result:
